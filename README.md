# About
## Weather App

This is a weather app which is for portfolio and not for release or monetize.

# Why I created this App
I created this app to practice using fetch API.
It is the first time to get json data from API and also creating an application for me.

I also tried to make beautiful layout even for mobile friendly. You can enjoy this app both web browsers and mobile devices.

# UI Design
![UI](./design.png)

I created UI design with [figma](https://www.figma.com/design/).
I arranged UI design during developing so first image is a little bit different from others. There are two types of background, daytime and nighttime. Also it will be changed depend on the local weather.
